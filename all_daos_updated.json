      "description": "Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) is a framework that enables on-demand horizontal scalability of networks by deploying \"subnets\" running different consensus algorithms depending on the application's requirements. It achieves scaling through the permission-less spawning of new blockchain sub-systems, which are composed of subnets. Subnets are organized in a hierarchy, with one parent subnet being able to spawn infinite child subnets. Within a hierarchical subsystem, subnets can seamlessly communicate with each other, reducing the need for cross-chain bridges. Subnets also have their own specific consensus algorithms, while leveraging security features from parent subnets. This allows dApps to use subnets for hosting sets of applications or to shard a single application, according to its various cost or performance needs. IPC-powered networks will also be able to dynamically adjust their throughput by spawning and closing temporary subnets as needed.",

PleasrDAO has set a precedent for bidding on unique pieces, many of which have powerful messages that transcend crypto. Dubbed as an art collecting empire, the DAO is experimenting with novel concepts in digital and community art ownership. Its members are exploring ideas such as fractionalizing iconic pieces to be distributed to, and owned by, the community. However, beyond just shared ownership of these pieces, the collective plans to apply creative innovations within DeFi to add and disseminate value. In a way, the DAO is a platform for collective experimentation at the nexus of community ownership, DeFi, and digital art. In essence, the DAO\u2019s modus operandi is to buy and fund culturally significant pieces and then create something fundamentally additive to the soul of the piece before sharing it back with the community.",

Like SMTP for email or HTTP for the web, DSNP is application-agnostic, allowing for an open marketplace and ecosystem of interoperable apps and services. DSNP serves as the linkage between the consensus layer (such as a public blockchain) and the application layer (social apps and websites), defining common operations and data structures. The consensus layer secures and stores important user information such as the relationships that form each user's social graph, and users control delegation and revocation of access to their data on a per-application basis. Since applications do not control user data, a user may freely choose another DSNP application without losing access to their social identity or social graph.",

Organic farming enhances soil health by using natural compost, crop rotation, and minimal chemical inputs, which nurture biodiversity and improve soil structure. This approach reduces erosion, enhances water retention, and promotes long-term fertility. Small-scale farming often complements organic practices by fostering diverse ecosystems, reducing the carbon footprint of large machinery, and prioritizing local food systems. Together, organic and small farming help maintain environmental balance, conserve resources, and create sustainable agricultural systems.",
